# hello-world
This is a test. This is only a test. If this had been an actual project it might be interesting.

While I've done development using C#, ASP.net, JS, etc. before in an enterprise environment, I have not used github. Thus I'm doing this tutorial to learn about it.

So far it seems pretty cool and straightforward. I will continue this exciting tutorial. Thanks for reading this exciting text!
